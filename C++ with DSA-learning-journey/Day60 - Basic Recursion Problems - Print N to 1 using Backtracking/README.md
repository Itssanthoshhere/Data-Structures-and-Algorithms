# Day 60: Basic Recursion - Print N to 1 Using Backtracking ðŸš€

## Overview
Today's challenge focuses on **Recursion** using a backtracking approach to print numbers from **N down to 1**. This exercise demonstrates how recursion, specifically **backtracking**, can be applied to reverse the order of outputs efficiently, making it a useful approach for solving certain types of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems.

---

## Problem Statement
**Print numbers from N to 1 using recursion.**

By making recursive calls until we reach the base condition, we print values in reverse order as the call stack unwinds, achieving a descending sequence from N to 1.

### Example:
- **Input**: N = 5
- **Output**: `5 4 3 2 1`

---

## Solution Approach

### Steps:
1. **Recursive Function**: Define a function `func(i, n)` that:
   - Recursively calls itself, incrementing `i` until it hits the base condition (`i > n`).
   - Prints the current value of `i` after returning from each recursive call, achieving the reverse order.

2. **Base Condition**: When `i` exceeds `n`, the function stops making recursive calls and begins unwinding.

3. **Backtracking**: The unwinding phase of recursion enables printing from N down to 1.

### Pseudocode
```cpp
void func(int i, int n) {
    if (i > n) return;
    func(i + 1, n);  // Recursive call to reach the base case
    cout << i << " "; // Printing as the call stack unwinds
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    func(1, n);
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Base Case**: Stops recursion when `i` becomes greater than `n`.
2. **Recursive Call**: Calls `func(i + 1, n)` until reaching the base case.
3. **Printing**: Prints each value from N to 1 as the stack unwinds, creating the reversed sequence.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)` - The function is called recursively `N` times.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(N)` - Each call is stored on the stack until the base case is reached.

## Key Learnings
- **Backtracking in Recursion**: This exercise showcases the power of recursion for reversing sequences and solving ordering problems.
- **Stack Unwinding**: Understanding how values are printed during stack unwinding is crucial for mastering backtracking techniques in recursive algorithms.

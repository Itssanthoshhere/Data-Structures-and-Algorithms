# Practiced a Question on Basic Recursion - Printing 1 to N Without Loops

Welcome to Day 55 of my C++ and DSA learning journey! Today, I explored recursion by solving a problem on printing numbers from 1 to N without using loops. This exercise reinforced my understanding of recursion as an alternative to iteration.

## üìö Topic Covered
- **Basic Recursion:** Learning to solve problems through recursive function calls, particularly by replacing loops with recursive solutions. This practice highlights the stack behavior of recursion and how functions can call themselves to achieve iterative tasks.

## üìù Problem Statement
### Problem: Print 1 to N Without Loops

Given an integer `N`, the task is to print numbers from 1 to `N` without using any loops. The solution must employ recursion to achieve this iterative task.

### Example
- **Input:** N = 5  
- **Output:** 1 2 3 4 5  

### Explanation
- The recursive function calls itself with `N-1` until it reaches the base case of `N = 0`, then unwinds to print each number from 1 up to `N`.

## üíª Code Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void printNos(int N) {
    if (N == 0) return;       // Base case: stop recursion when N reaches 0
    printNos(N - 1);          // Recursive call with (N - 1)
    cout << N << " ";         // Print N on the way back up the recursion stack
}

int main() {
    int N;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> N;
    printNos(N);              // Call the function to print 1 to N
    return 0;
}
```

## üóùÔ∏è Key Learnings
- **Base Condition:** Essential to prevent infinite recursion and control when the recursion stops.
- **Recursive Stack:** Understanding how recursive calls are added to the stack, with the last function call completing first (LIFO), achieving a "reverse order" effect for printing from 1 to `N`.
- **Problem-Solving with Recursion:** A foundational problem that develops logical thinking and the ability to visualize recursive processes.

# Day 56: Basic Recursion - Print a Name N Times

Welcome to Day 56 of my DSA learning journey with C++! Today, I explored a foundational concept in recursion, practicing how to print a name "N" times without using loops. This README provides a breakdown of the challenge, code, and key insights about recursion.

## üöÄ Problem Statement
Given an integer `N`, print a specified name `N` times using recursion. This challenge serves as an introduction to recursion and shows how recursive functions can replace loops for repetitive tasks.

## üñ•Ô∏è Solution Code
Here's the C++ code implementing the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void printName(int i, int n) {
    // Base condition
    if (i > n) {
        return;
    }
    cout << "Santhosh" << endl;
    printName(i + 1, n); // Recursive call
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the number of times to print the name: ";
    cin >> n;
    printName(1, n); // Start recursion from 1 to N
    return 0;
}
```

## üìù Explanation
1. **Base Case**: The recursion stops when `i` exceeds `n`, preventing an infinite recursive loop.
2. **Print Step**: Outputs the name "Santhosh" for each recursive call.
3. **Recursive Step**: Calls `printName(i + 1, n)`, incrementing `i` by 1 until reaching the base case.

## üîÑ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)` ‚Äî We make `N` recursive calls.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(N)` ‚Äî Each call uses stack space until reaching the base case.

## üìä Example Output
**Input**: `N = 5`  
**Output**:  
```
Santhosh
Santhosh
Santhosh
Santhosh
Santhosh
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Additional Practice Problem
I also tackled a similar problem on [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-gfg-n-times/1?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=collab_striver_ytdescription&utm_campaign=print-gfg-n-times) which involves printing "GFG" `N` times.

```cpp
void printGfg(int N) {
    if (N <= 0) return;
    cout << "GFG ";
    printGfg(N - 1);
}
```

## üåü Key Takeaways
- **Recursion** provides an alternative to loops by breaking down tasks into simpler repetitive calls.
- **Base Case** in recursion is crucial to avoid infinite calls and stack overflow.
- **Stack Frames**: Each recursive call adds a new frame to the stack, making it essential to manage memory and performance carefully.

# Practiced a Question on Basic Recursion - Factorial Numbers Less Than or Equal to N in C++

Welcome to Day 65 of my C++ and DSA learning journey! Today, I focused on solving a problem related to finding all factorial numbers that are less than or equal to a given number `n`. This task was a great exercise in recursion and helped me understand how to break down problems with mathematical concepts.

## üìö Topic Covered
- **Recursion:** In this problem, we explored how to find all factorial numbers less than or equal to `n`. It provided insights into recursive problem-solving and how to approach such challenges iteratively to optimize performance.

## üìù Problem Statement
### Problem: Find all Factorial Numbers Less Than or Equal to N

Given a number `n`, the goal is to return a list of all factorial numbers smaller than or equal to `n`.

### Example
- **Input:** n = 6
- **Output:** `1, 2, 6`

### Explanation
- We need to calculate factorial numbers starting from `1!` and check if they are less than or equal to `n`. Once the factorial value exceeds `n`, we stop.

## üíª Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void findFactorials(int n) {
    int fact = 1;
    vector<int> result;
    int i = 1;
    while (fact <= n) {
        result.push_back(fact);
        i++;
        fact *= i;
    }
    
    // Displaying the result
    for (int i = 0; i < result.size(); i++) {
        cout << result[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a number n: ";
    cin >> n;
    findFactorials(n);
    return 0;
}
```

## üóùÔ∏è Key Learnings
- **Recursive Thinking:** This problem reinforced the concept of factorials and helped me understand how to implement them efficiently.
- **Iterative Solution:** Using an iterative approach for factorial calculation was optimal for this problem, as it reduced the complexity and made the algorithm more memory efficient compared to a pure recursive solution.
- **Efficient Factorial Calculation:** The factorial values grow rapidly, so understanding how to handle them effectively is crucial when working with larger numbers.
